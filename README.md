# 🌆 CitySync

**CitySync** is a mobile-first civic engagement platform that empowers citizens to report public
issues, participate in local community events, and earn **Deed Points** for contributing to social
good. It bridges the gap between citizens, local governments, and NGOs to build smarter, more
responsive, and more sustainable communities.
